# TacSA

The initial concept for TacSA was to develop a reasonably complex python program to up-skill my Python capabilities, whilst specificlly offer a platform, for which I knew I could underpin with AWS/Azure and a very detailed underlying, complex architecutre. It was called TacSA, due to it being a **Tac**tical SIM - to underpin my **S**olution **A**rchitecture development (TacSA).

I decided to make it more "saleable" and "brand like". So it became TacSA - Technical Analytics for Complex Systems Architectures (but don't tell anyone!).

TacSA is an abstract, safe-by-design simulation and architecture demonstrator. It showcases full-stack architecture, cloud-native deployment, and systems thinking through a modular Python engine, FastAPI backend, and AWS-hosted UI.
